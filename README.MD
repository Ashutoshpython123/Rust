Rust Concept
Rust is a statically and strongly typed compiled language known for its exceptional speed, reliability, and high-level features combined with low-level control. This README aims to provide a brief overview of Rust and its core concepts.

Statically and Strongly Typed
Rust enforces strict typing at compile-time, ensuring type safety and preventing common runtime errors such as null pointer dereferencing and type mismatches. This static and strong typing system enables developers to write robust and reliable code.

Compiled Language
Being a compiled language, Rust code is translated into machine code before execution, resulting in highly optimized and efficient binaries. The compilation process catches errors early, promoting a smoother development experience and improving overall code quality.

Extremely Fast and Reliable
Rust's emphasis on performance and reliability makes it a preferred choice for systems programming tasks where speed and correctness are critical. Its zero-cost abstractions and minimal runtime overhead make Rust code highly performant without sacrificing safety.

High-Level Features with Low-Level Control
Rust empowers developers with high-level features typically found in modern programming languages, such as pattern matching, generics, and trait-based polymorphism. Additionally, it provides fine-grained control over memory management and system resources, making it suitable for low-level programming tasks like writing device drivers and operating systems.
